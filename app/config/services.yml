    # It's not mandatory to create these services, but if you use repositories a lot,
    # these services simplify your code:

    # app.post_repository:
    #     class:     Doctrine\ORM\EntityRepository
    #     factory:   ['@doctrine.orm.entity_manager', getRepository]

    # $entityManager = $this->getDoctrine()->getManager();
    # $posts = $entityManager->getRepository('AppBundle:Post')->findAll();
    #
    # // same code using repository services
    # $posts = $this->get('app.post_repository')->findAll();
